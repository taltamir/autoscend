any	2	auto_delayHauntedKitchen	boolean	Should we delay the Haunted Kitchen until we have 9 resist? (Or in Ed, Even More Elemental Wards)?

any	4	auto_getDinseyGarbageMoney	boolean	Spend a few turns getting the easy FunBucks during a run?

any	37	auto_save_adv_override	integer	Set an override to amount of adv to save at end of day. Set to -1 to handle this automatically.

Also some shorthands are allowed in case you forgot which moonsign is which, such as famweight/clover/food/booze. You will be prompted to confirm that you actually do want to change signs automatically once per ascension (although it will automatically assume that you do after 15 seconds of inactivity), so forgetting to change the value in advance should not be a concern.

any	47	auto_helpMeMafiaIsSuperBrokenAaah	boolean	Pretty much just for werebear. If for some reason you find that mafia completely fails to detect item drops occasionally, leading to wasting a ton of adventures continuing to look for an item you already found, try this out.
