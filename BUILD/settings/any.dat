auto_delayHauntedKitchen	boolean	Should we delay the Haunted Kitchen until we have 9 resist? (Or in Ed, Even More Elemental Wards)?

auto_saveMagicalSausage	boolean	When true, don't eat magical sausage, so you can save them up for aftercore.
auto_useWishes	boolean	When true, use the Genie Bottle to go faster in non-Community Service runs.
auto_spoonsign	string	What sign to change to with the hewn moon-rune spoon after finishing any business in the current sign. If blank or invalid, we won't switch automatically. Can be set to any of the 9 main sign names, or knoll/canadia/gnomad to automatically select the appropriate sign within that zone based on your mainstat. Also some shorthands are allowed in case you forgot which moonsign is which, such as famweight/clover/food/booze. You will be prompted to confirm that you actually do want to change signs automatically once per ascension (although it will automatically assume that you do after 15 seconds of inactivity), so forgetting to change the value in advance should not be a concern.

auto_secondPlaceOrBust	boolean	When true, abort before each tower test if we can't get to second place.
auto_helpMeMafiaIsSuperBrokenAaah	boolean	Pretty much just for werebear. If for some reason you find that mafia completely fails to detect item drops occasionally, leading to wasting a ton of adventures continuing to look for an item you already found, try this out.
